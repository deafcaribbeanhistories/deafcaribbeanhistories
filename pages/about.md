The digital archive contains personal and community histories from deaf individuals across the Caribbean, using indigenous Caribbean signed languages. This initiative includes communities from Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana, Providence Island (Colombia), the Bay Islands (Honduras), and Puerto Rico. This archive seeks to provide a crucial resource for education, research, and advocacy, shedding light on the often-overlooked histories of Caribbean deaf communities.

Historically, Caribbean signed languages have received minimal attention compared to spoken languages. Past ideologies and technical challenges in documenting visual languages contributed to this neglect. To the extent that the histories of Caribbean deaf communities have been documented at all, it has been done by hearing people, reported in written languages, inaccessible to most members of Caribbean deaf communities. 

However, recent advancements in video technology have enabled the creation of comprehensive digital collections, capturing the rich linguistic and cultural heritage of Caribbean deaf communities. These recordings contain a wealth of historical narratives from deaf people themselves, expressed in their own languages. This project utilises these collections, drawing from previous and ongoing documentation efforts, to curate an archive of Caribbean deaf history. 

The project contributors comprise both deaf and hearing researchers, who each contributed to the curation and collection of archival materials. The digital archive aims to educate deaf children about their linguistic and community histories, support language rights advocacy, and serve as a multidisciplinary research resource.

## Credits

_Facets_ is the team work of Angela Zoss and Alex Gil. During the lockdown, they met religiously for two hours every week. They finally met in real life once the project was almost complete. _Facets_ builds on the work of Marii Nyröp, and the cheerful encouragement of the Wax community which gathers on [a channel on the Code4Lib Slack](https://code4lib.slack.com/archives/C01DKQ44GE4).

### Angela Zoss

Angela is the [Assessment &amp; Data Visualization Analyst](https://library.duke.edu/about/directory/staff/angela.zoss) in the
[Assessment &amp; User Experience Department](https://library.duke.edu/about/depts/assessment-user-experience) in the
[Duke University Libraries](https://library.duke.edu/). She has many years of experience
in teaching and training, predominantly focusing on teaching data visualization to
university students, faculty, and staff. She is also active in several open
source development projects, including [FOLIO](https://github.com/folio-org/) and
[Wax](https://github.com/minicomp/wax).

### Alex Gil

Alex Gil is the Digital Scholarship Librarian at Columbia University, where he collaborates with faculty, students and library colleagues in humanities research, pedagogy and knowledge production that involves the use of advanced computation, digital media design, and network technologies. He is the lead coordinator for the [Butler Library Studio](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University Libraries, co-host of [Studio Remote](https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio), and co-founder of Columbia’s [Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research](http://xpmethod.columbia.edu/).

### Wax

[Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) is a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) framework for the creation of static web collections and exhibits led by [Marii Nyröp](http://marii.info/). The project is currently maintained by Marii Nyröp at New York University and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex) at Columbia University Libraries. Wax depends on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator, and a host of other open source libraries and frameworks including [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/). Wax builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others.
